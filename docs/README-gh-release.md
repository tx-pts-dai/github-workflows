## FAQs

**Q: How is the version number determined?**

A: The version number is determined by fetching all tags, sorting them, and retrieving the latest version. If no tags are found, it defaults to v0.0.1.

**Q: How are the release notes generated?**

A: The release notes are automatically generated by the `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` action.

**Q: How is the new release managed?**

A: The release automatically increases the patch version, but also tags the *MAJOR* and *MAJOR.MINOR* versions to point to the latest commit. As example, let's say we currently are at version v1.1.1. Using the release pipeline will increase the patch version (-> v1.1.2), and also will renew tagging so that workflows already calling @v1 or @v1.1 would target the new release v1.1.2 instead of the previous v1.1.1. Running caller workflows should automatically target the newer version.
